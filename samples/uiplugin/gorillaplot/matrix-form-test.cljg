;;; # Thinking about core.matrix rendering
;;; 
;;; Gorilla's renderer at the moment works by dispatching the render call on type. How might this work with core.matrix, and other things that are defined by _protocol_?
;;; 
;;; One idea, sketched out in this worksheet is to use a view-function, much like is done in Mathematica. Internally it will work by wrapping the matrix in a marker type, but this should be viewed as an implementation detail.
;;; 
;;; In Mathematica, matrices are represented by lists-of-lists, and on the whole, the notebook doesn't do anything special with them, displaying them like flat lists-of-lists. There'a a function, `MatrixForm` whose job is to tag the data for display in the front end as a matrix.
;;; 
;;; ### Implementation
;;; 
;;; We'll start with the implementation - skip below to see how it looks from the user perspective.
